Conducted a multivariate analysis of bird community structure - multi-dimensional non-parametric scaling. They also counted the number of people in the count sectors. Contrary to expectation, birds were more abundant in areas with greater human density - probably due to shared habitat features such as presence of benthic organisms. However within Saco, monthly counts allowed comparison of days with and without people. Abundance, particularly of larger bodues species, was higher when people weren't present, suggesting human presence directly impacts large wader abundance. The Banco also had higher mean bird density than the disturbed Saco, but mean bird mass was lower, contrary to expectations. This suggests larger and smaller waders exhibit different responses to human presence with smaller waders selecting areas with lower human disturbance and fleeing before reducing their foraging time.",Complicated picture - hard to tell if effect overall negative or neutral. Would suggest from local responses that human disturbance does have a negative impact overall.,Yes,,,,,,,,

Flight responses were rare and typicaly encountered when the UAV was launched directly at flocks at low altitude (10-15m) during take-off. Little to no disturbance effects were observed when UAVs were flown at least 60m (fixed-wing) or 40m (multirotor) above the birds.

Used a Bayesian Optimality model to infer the distribution of prior estimates of risk for each waterbird species and level of human disturbance. Mean and relative differences between inferred prior distributions at different levels of risk were used to quantify a species' overall sensitivity to disturbance. In general, populations in low activity sites had higher mean priors (perceived risk of attact from an approaching human) and FIDs, and lower mean priors and FIDs in high activity sites.

After controlling for sampling unit size, potential raptor disturbance and habitat type, 7 of 14 models evaluated indicated a significant negative association of disturbance on human abundance. Magnitude of significant declines varied among seasons and species groups but ranged from 23-63% in the expected abundance of waders in the units with an average amount of human disturbance compared to the units with no disturbance.

Modelled the probability of flying, and time to resettle as a function of disturbance type, flcok size, shorebird taxa (knots vs sandplovers), FID, tide height, time since last disturbance and time since arrival. Flight probability differed between taxa and was strongly influenced by flock size (decreased with increasing flock size) and FID. Knots had a larger FID than sandplovers. Resettle Time also varied between taxa and flock size although the best model also included time since arrival. This suggests potential habituation over the non-breeding period.

Human presence counted directly by observers during surveys - number of people and unleashed dogs. Overall human density was also emasured based on urbanisation and human population density. These four measures were highly correlated and aggregated into a PCA - 2 principal components. Positive values of  PC1 indicating decreasing disturbance levels whilst PC\ distinguishes effects of direct disturbance and overall human presence - positive valyes indicating higher direct disturbance and negative values indicating higher overall human presence. The results indicate that most specues are more abundant near areas of high human presence but within these areas avoid direct disturbance from people and unleashed dogs.""",Human variables aggregated between measures of human density and direct disturbance into a PCA - allows discernment that human presence is correlated positively with wadrer abundance but direct disturbance leads to reductions in local abundance.,Yes,,,,,,,,

Crop type noted and fields split into broad habitat categories and assigned into six broad areas - within-day movements between these rare. Behavioural observations made at three periods - early, mid and late season - used flock scans - behaviours assigned to 14 catergories. Proportion of birds feeding, alert, or engaged in other activities determined per scan. Potential (humans present in the same area) and actual disturbances (>5% flock vigilant were recorded. Type of activity, distance to birds and duration recorded. Cars only included when not on public roads - distance to roads separate variable. Swans susceptibility to human activity recorded as disturbanc efrequency (no. events/hour) and distance to nearest birds. Also calculated recovery rates following disturbance. Disturbance events given a number per day to assess habituation. Sources grouped into 6 categories - motor vehicles, bikes, pedestrians, hunters (wildfowlers and anglers), aircraft and cattle. Variation in time spent feeding and alert analysed in relation to year, season, floodplain area, disturbance type using ANOVAs. Factors affecting swans susceptibility to disturbance (frequency and distance) and whether feeding and alert behaviour varied with time/location analysed using GLMs. Disturbance frequency was negatively correlated with flock size and distance to road/track. Distances which humans could approach varied with field and flock size and also with type of disturbance involved. The distance at which >5% of the flock became alert decreased with the number of previous disturbance events that day suggesting habituation within the course of the day although there was no evidence this persisted over longer time periods. Recovery rates also varied with duration of disturbance event which varied between disturbance types, along with field size, flock size and the proportion of flock alerted. Birds had lower alert distances for pedestrians than wildfowlers or anglers but greeater than for cyclists. Flight was most frequently triggered by pedestrians (34.7% of 121 disturbance-related flights).

For each disturbance, recorded flock size, number disturbed, number disturbed, nature of response (returned/left completely), disturbance source - humans (with/without dogs), vehicles/boats, aircraft, gunfire and unknown and duration of flight. Goose minutes per flight - n birds x duration. Analysed mean duration of flight per event caused by each source - represents energy expenditure. Also calculated diurnal activity budgets and multiplied this to calculate daily energy expenditure using figures from the literature. Pedestrians were the most frequent disturbance source (31.9%).
