# Wildfowl SLR

This repository contains the code to make all figures for a report comissioned by Natural England containing two systematic reviews of the impacts of disturbance from wildfowling and recreational activities and mortality from wildfowling on waterbirds. It also contains code to make figures summarising population trends of UK waterbirds using data from the 2019/20 Wetland Bird Survey report from the British Trust for Ornithology (Frost et al. 2021)
