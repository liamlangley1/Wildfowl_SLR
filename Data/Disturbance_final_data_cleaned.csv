Conducted a multivariate analysis of bird community structure - multi-dimensional non-parametric scaling. They also counted the number of people in the count sectors. Contrary to expectation, birds were more abundant in areas with greater human density - probably due to shared habitat features such as presence of benthic organisms. However within Saco, monthly counts allowed comparison of days with and without people. Abundance, particularly of larger bodues species, was higher when people weren't present, suggesting human presence directly impacts large wader abundance. The Banco also had higher mean bird density than the disturbed Saco, but mean bird mass was lower, contrary to expectations. This suggests larger and smaller waders exhibit different responses to human presence with smaller waders selecting areas with lower human disturbance and fleeing before reducing their foraging time. ",Complicated picture - hard to tell if effect overall negative or neutral. Would suggest from local responses that human disturbance does have a negative impact overall.,Yes

Crop type noted and fields split into broad habitat categories and assigned into six broad areas - within-day movements between these rare. Behavioural observations made at three periods - early, mid and late season - used flock scans - behaviours assigned to 14 catergories. Proportion of birds feeding, alert, or engaged in other activities determined per scan. Potential (humans present in the same area) and actual disturbances (>5% flock vigilant were recorded.

Swans susceptibility to human activity recorded as disturbanc efrequency (no. events/hour) and distance to nearest birds. Also calculated recovery rates following disturbance. Disturbance events given a number per day to assess habituation. Sources grouped into 6 categories - motor vehicles, bikes, pedestrians, hunters (wildfowlers and anglers), aircraft and cattle. Variation in time spent feeding and alert analysed in relation to year, season, floodplain area, disturbance type using ANOVAs. Factors affecting swans susceptibility to disturbance (frequency and distance) and whether feeding and alert behaviour varied with time/location analysed using GLMs. Disturbance frequency was negatively correlated with flock size and distance to road/track. Distances which humans could approach varied with field and flock size and also with type of disturbance involved.
